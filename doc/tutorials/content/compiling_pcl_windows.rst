Compiling PCL and its dependencies from source in Windows
---------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial explains how to build the Point Cloud Library **from source** on
Microsoft Windows platforms, and tries to guide you through the download and
the compilation *of all the required dependencies*. The illustrated compilation
process produces a static library.

Requirements
-------------

In order to compile every component of the PCL library we need to download and
compile a series of 3rd party library dependencies:

	- **Boost** version >= 1.46.1 (http://www.boost.org/)

    used for shared pointers, and threading. **mandatory**

	- **Eigen** version >= 3.0.0 (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)

    used as the matrix backend for SSE optimized math. **mandatory**

	- **CMINPACK** version >= 1.1.3 (http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/cminpack/cminpack.html)

    used in the `sample_consensus` and `registration` modules for non-linear
    (Levenberg-Marquardt) optimizations. **mandatory**

	- **FLANN** version >= 1.6.8 (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/FLANN)

    used in `kdtree` for fast approximate nearest neighbors search. **mandatory**

	- **Visualization ToolKit (VTK)** version >= 5.6.1 (http://www.vtk.org/)

    used in `visualization` for 3D point cloud rendering and visualization. **mandatory**
	
	- **googletest** version >= 1.6.0 (http://code.google.com/p/googletest/)

    used to build test units. **optional**

	- **QHULL** version >= 2011.1 (http://www.qhull.org/)

    used for convex/concave hull decompositions in `surface`. **optional**

	- **wxWidgets** version >= 2.8.1 (http://www.wxwidgets.org/)

    used for `pcl::RangeImage` visualizations. **optional**

	- **OpenNI** version >= 1.1.0.25 (http://www.openni.org/)

    used to grab point clouds from OpenNI compliant devices. **optional**


.. note::
  
   Though not a dependency per se, don't forget that you also need the CMake
   build system (http://www.cmake.org/), at least version **2.8.3**. We recommend
   version **2.8.4**. A Subversion client for Windows, i.e. TortoiseSVN 
   (http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/), is also required to download the PCL source code.

Downloading PCL source code
---------------------------
Subversion is a version control system similar to CVS which allows developers to simultaneously work on PCL. 
The download operation of the most recent source from the main development line, known as trunk, is called `checkout`.

To checkout PCL source code, navigate to the C:/ folder using Windows file manager. Then right click and choose
`SVN Checkout...` from the contextual menu. Set "URL of repository" to http://svn.pointclouds.org/pcl/trunk and
"Checkout directory" to C:/PCL.

   :align: center
   
Click "OK" and the download should start. At the end of this process, you will have PCL source code in C:\PCL.
   
Building dependencies
---------------------
Let's unpack all our libraries in C:/PCL_dependencies so that it would like
like::

	C:/PCL_dependencies
	C:/PCL_dependencies/boost_1_46_1
	C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3
	C:/PCL_dependencies/eigen
	C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.6.8-src
	C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0
	C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull
	C:/PCL_dependencies/VTK
	C:/PCL_dependencies/wxWidgets
	
Let's start with `Boost`, which does not use CMake. To build Boost, open the
command prompt and navigate to the Boost folder::

	prompt> cd c:\PCL_dependencies\boost_1_46_1
	prompt> bootstrap
	
Depending on the compilation toolchain you intend to use to build PCL, you need
to change the following `--toolset` argument to msvc-8.0, msvc-9.0 (Visual
Studio 2008) or msvc-10.0 (Visual Studio 2010). A comprehensive list of supported
compilers can be found on the Boost manual (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_0/more/getting_started/windows.html#identify-your-toolset).
To make Boost build system produce 64 bit libraries instead of 32 bit ones, change
the `address-model` option to 64. 

	prompt> bjam --toolset=msvc-9.0 link=static address-model=32 --with-thread --with-system --with-filesystem --with-date_time --build-type=complete stage

The previous command line will build 32 bit static libraries using Visual Studio 2008
Hit enter and grab some coffee because this will take some time. 

Once done, proceed to compile `cminpack`. If you are using CMinpack version 1.1.3 and you intend
to build the static version of this library, please patch the C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3/CMakeLists.txt
as described on PCL issue tracker at http://dev.pointclouds.org/issues/85#note-8 .

Then open CMake-gui and fill in the fields::

  Where is my source code: C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3
  Where to build binaries: C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3/bin32
  
.. image:: images/cmake_cminpack_1.png
   :alt: CMake configuration dialog
   :align: center  
  
 .. note::
  
  If you are building 64 bit libraries, I suggest you to choose as binaries output folder bin64 
  instead of bin32. This way, in case you need to build the 32 bit version too, they can both
  coexist under C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3
  
Hit the "Configure" button and CMake will tell that the binaries folder doesn't exist yet 
(e.g., *C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3/bin32*) and it will ask for a confirmation.

.. image:: images/cmake_cminpack_2.png
   :alt: CMake binaries folder creation
   :align: center  
   
Proceed and be sure to choose the correct "Generator" on the next window. So,
if you've built Boost using the Visual Studio 2008 toolset you would choose the
same generator here.  

.. image:: images/cmake_cminpack_3.png
   :alt: CMake generator selection
   :align: center  

.. note::
  
  Don't forget that all the dependencies must be compiled using the same
  compiler options and architecture specifications, i.e. you can't mix 32 bit
  libraries with 64 bit libraries.

Be sure to set the following options::

 SHARED_LIBS                      OFF
 BUILD_EXAMPLES                   OFF
 BUILD_EXAMPLES_FORTRAN           OFF

Hit "Configure" again and then go for the "Generate" button. This will generate
the required project files/makefiles to build the library. Now you can simply
go to `C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3/bin32` and proceed with the compilation using
your toolchain. In case you use Visual Studio, you will find the Visual Studio
Solution file in that folder: be sure to build the whole solution by choosing the
Build Solution command of the Build menu. 

Let's move on to `FLANN`. Setup the CMake fields as usual::

  Where is my source code: C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.6.8-src
  Where to build binaries: C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.6.8-src/bin32

Hit "Configure" and as for the previous steps, confirm and choose the correct
"Generator". Now, on my machine I had to manually set the `BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS`
and `BUILD_MATLAB_BINDINGS` to OFF otherwise it would not continue to the next
step as it is complaining about unable to find Python and Matlab. Click on
"Advanced mode" and find them, or alternatively, add those entries by clicking
on the "Add Entry" button in the top right of the CMake-gui window.  Add one
entry named "BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS", set its type to "Bool" and its value to
unchecked. Do the same with the "BUILD_MATLAB_BINDINGS" entry. Now hit the
"Configure" button and it should work. Go for the "Generate" button and proceed
to the compilation phase.

.. note::
  
  If you don't have a Python interpreter installed CMake would probably not allow you
  to generate the project files. To solve this problem you can install the Python interpreter
  (http://www.python.org/download/windows/) or comment the `add_subdirectory( test )` line 
  from C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.6.8-src/CMakeLists.txt .
  
In case you want PCL tests, you need to compile the `googletest` library (GTest). 
Setup the CMake fields as usual::

  Where is my source code: C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0
  Where to build binaries: C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0/bin32

Hit "Configure" and set the following options::

 BUILD_SHARED_LIBS                      OFF
 gtest_force_shared_crt					(ON if you are building PCL as a static library, OFF otherwise)
 
Generate and build the resulting project.
 
Setup the CMake fields with the `qhull` paths::

  Where is my source code: C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull
  Where to build binaries: C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull/bin32
  
Then hit "Configure" twice and "Generate". Compile the generated project files.

The procedure is virtually the same for `VTK` so I won't show it again here.

Building `wxWidgets` is a bit different: go to the
C:/PCL_dependencies/wxWidgets/build/msw folder, open the project file and build
the "Debug" and "Release" configurations. Don't use the DLL* configurations.

That's it, we're done with the dependencies!

Environment variables
---------------------

To make it easier for CMake to find the compiled 3rd party libraries you can define the following
environment variables:

* **BOOST_ROOT**: `C:/PCL_dependencies/boost_1_46_1`  
* **CMINPACK_ROOT**: `C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3`  
* **QHULL_ROOT**: `C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull`  
* **FLANN_ROOT**: `C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.6.8-src`  
* **EIGEN_ROOT**: `C:/PCL_dependencies/eigen`  

.. note::
  
   Please make sure that CMake-Gui is not running when setting environment variables otherwise
   it may not be able to detect them.
   
Building PCL
------------

Let's assume that the PCL source code is in C:/PCL. Run the CMake-gui
application and fill in the fields::

  Where is my source code: C:/PCL
  Where to build binaries: C:/PCL/bin32

Now hit the "Configure" button. As for the dependencies, choose the correct
Generator and continue.

Because CMake is unable to find all the 3rd party libraries you installed by
itself, it will prompt you to input their paths manually. 

Because this tutorial is exemplifying the process of compiling PCL as a
**static** library, the first thing you have to do is to uncheck the
**PCL->PCL_SHARED_LIBS** checkbox. Also uncheck **BUILD->BUILD_TESTS** and
**BUILD->BUILD_global_tests** unless you plan to run the unit tests as a
developer.

Now examine the CMake-gui log window. You should see some red colored error
stating that CMake could not find library XXX. The GUI will also highlight in
red the items which need to be modified. In my case the first time it couldn't
find the EIGEN library, so it said::

	Could NOT find Eigen (missing: EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR) .

Simply modify the **EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR** key to point to the correct Eigen include
directory (C:/PCL_dependencies/eigen in our case). 

Now hit the "Configure" button again. Like before, look for the error in the
log area and sort it out by modifying the related key above the "Configure"
button. Repeat the process until you've done with the errors.

A little trick: when it comes to BOOST or wxWidgets errors, just set the
**wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR** and **Boost_INCLUDE_DIR** elements to the appropriate paths. The
CMake build system will figure out the other related paths automatically.

Once all the reported errors are sorted out the "Generate" button becomes
available. Hit it and a project will be generated in C:/PCL/bin32.

During the CMake configuration for the PCL project, the following options were set::

  Boost_INCLUDE_DIR				"C:/PCL_dependencies/boost_1_46_1"
  CMINPACK_IS_STATIC			(ON if you are building PCL as a static library, OFF otherwise) 
  CMINPACK_INCLUDE_DIR			"C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3/" 
  CMINPACK_LIBRARY				"C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3/bin32/Release/cminpack.lib" 
  CMINPACK_LIBRARY_DEBUG		"C:/PCL_dependencies/cminpack-1.1.3/bin32/Debug/cminpack.lib" 
  EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR				"C:/PCL_dependencies/eigen" 
  FLANN_INCLUDE_DIR				"C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.6.8-src/src/cpp" 
  FLANN_LIBRARY					"C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.6.8-src/lib/Release/flann_cpp_s.lib" 
  FLANN_LIBRARY_DEBUG			"C:/PCL_dependencies/flann-1.6.8-src/lib/Debug/flann_cpp_s.lib" 
  GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR				"C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0/include" 
  GTEST_LIBRARY					"C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0/bin32/Release/gtest.lib" 
  GTEST_LIBRARY_DEBUG			"C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0/bin32/Debug/gtest.lib" 
  GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY			"C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0/bin32/Release/gtest_main.lib" 
  GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY_DEBUG		"C:/PCL_dependencies/gtest-1.6.0/bin32/Debug/gtest_main.lib" 
  OPENNI_INCLUDE_DIR			"C:/Program Files (x86)/OpenNI/Include"
  OPENNI_LIBRARY				"C:/Program Files (x86)/OpenNI/Lib/openNI.lib"
  PCL_SHARED_LIBS				(OFF if you want PCL to be a static library, ON if you want PCL to be a shared library/DLL)
  BUILD_TESTS					(ON if you are interested in building software testing units)
  BUILD_global_tests			(ON if you are interested in building software testing units)
  BUILD_visualization			(ON if you want to build the optional visualization component) 
  QHULL_LIBRARY					"C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull/bin32/src/Release/qhull.lib" 
  QHULL_INCLUDE_DIR				"C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull" 
  QHULL_LIBRARY_DEBUG			"C:/PCL_dependencies/qhull/bin32/src/Debug/qhull.lib" 
  VTK_DIR						"C:/PCL_dependencies/vtk-5.6.1-mod/bin32"  

.. note::
  
  In order to correctly link against the FLANN library, you have to use the flann_cpp_s library file. The use
  of other files will result in undefined symbols and various linking time errors.
  
Open that folder and use the generated project to finally build the PCL library
using the toolchain of your choice.

Using PCL
---------

We finally managed to compile the Point Cloud Library (PCL) as binaries for
Windows. You can start using them in your project by following the
:ref:`using_pcl` tutorial.
